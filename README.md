## Goal

Classify candidates into non-stroke and stroke patients based on the inhibition between Tibialis Anterior and Soleus muscles under limited data points.

## Analysis

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Built a second-order WLS polynomial regression model with effect coding technique applied to capture the relationship between the powers of Tibialis Anterior and Soleus muscles.
3. Classified candidates into non-stroke and stroke patients according to the coefficients' values of above model.

## Conclusion

Obtained 100% accuracy by succeeding detecting 3 stroke patients out of 17 candidates.
