## Goal

Classify stroke patient based on the inhibition between Tibialis Anterior and Soleus muscles under limited data points.

## Analysis

1. Exploratory Data Analysis
2. Built a second-order WLS polynomial regression model with effect coding technique applied
3. Classified stroke patient based on the values of coefficients.

## Conclusion

Obtained 100% accuracy by succeeding classifying 3 strke patients out of 17 candidates.
